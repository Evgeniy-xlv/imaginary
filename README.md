**Imaginary** – a Minecraft mod which gives an abilitiy to add images to Minecraft. This mod supports any formats that Minecraft supports for textures (**PNG**, **JPEG** and **GIF** without animations). This mod is built for Minecraft 1.10.2 and Forge 12.18.3.2185. No compatibility with multiplayer available yet (it's planned for next update, though).

<!-- I didn't knew how to word it, but I meant of "reminding of mod." I had this idea since September of 2016, but didn't really needed this functionality for my machinimas -->

Thanks goes to [Tom Soel](https://twitter.com/TomSoel/) for reminding me of the idea for this mod.
