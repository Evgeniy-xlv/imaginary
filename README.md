**Imaginary** is a Minecraft mod which abilitiy to add images (.**PNG**, .**JPEG** or .**GIF**) to Minecraft. This mod is built for Minecraft 1.10.2 and  Forge 12.18.3.2185.

I'm lazy to document this mod, currently, so I'm just going to do it after the New Year, but all you need to know is the location where to put **PNG**, **JPEG** or **GIF**:

    .minecraft/conifg/imaginary/pictures/

This folder will be created automatically after the first launch of the game. Pictures aren't available in multiplayer, yet.

Thanks goes to [Tom Soel](https://twitter.com/TomSoel/) for giving me an idea for this mod.
