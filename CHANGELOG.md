# Imaginary change log

You totally see what I did there, didn't you? I should've called this mod Stickers, but Imaginary sounds much better!

## Version 1.0

The first release of this mod. Currently it adds an item, an entity and full support for stickers and your imagination to attach images on different surfaces.

- Added *Picture* item which spawns an image entity
- Added *Image* entity which is able to render chosen image from the pictures folder
- Added **Imaginary Picture** GUI which allows configuring of the *image* entity
- No multiplayer support
